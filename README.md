# moisture-sensor
Arduino library for a soil moisture sensor

Just a basic library for working with an analog soil moisture sensor on the Arduino. 
As of the initial release there is a function for reading the raw output from the sensor and printing that output to the serial monitor.
I'll be adding to the functionality for the time being, and adding all updates here. This is my first time writing a library for Arduino or anything, so all feedback is most welcome.
9/18 - Added function to reformat raw analog data as a number between 0 and 100

If anybody has any questions or comments, please let me know.

Thanks
